          <p>User interfaces (UI) connect users with digital experiences and products, enabling interaction with websites, apps, and software. UI combines text, images, and buttons for a visually engaging experience that caters to human needs.<br><br>Three primary attributes define user interfaces: they serve users by understanding their needs, provide intuitive experiences through consistent and easy-to-navigate designs, and enable simple task completion. Well-designed UI shapes digital interactions, contributing to positive user experiences.</p>

          <p>Deceptive patterns, also known as dark patterns, are manipulative design elements in user interfaces that trick users into performing unintended actions.<br><br>They exist primarily to benefit businesses by increasing revenue, user engagement, or data collection, often at the expense of users' interests. These patterns are considered unethical because they exploit human psychology and take advantage of users' trust, leading to negative experiences and potentially negative consequences for users who fall victim to these manipulative designs.</p>

      <div class="info_panel">
        <div class="text_panel">
          <p>Misdirection is a technique in deceptive patterns that uses elements and confusing layouts to distract users from important information or actions.<br><br>Examples of misdirection include ads designed as content, loud elements that distract attention from important actions or choices, and hard to find account settings. By taking advantage of users' trust and cognitive biases, misdirection can lead to negative experiences and potential problems for those who fall for these manipulative designs.</p>

      <div class="info_panel">
        <div class="text_panel">
          <p>Forced Continuity is a tactic in deceptive patterns that involves enrolling users in automatic renewals or subscriptions, often without explicit consent.<br><br>Examples of forced continuity include free trials that automatically convert to paid subscriptions, unclear cancellation processes, and hidden renewal fees. Forced continuity takes advantage of users' trust and inattention, resulting in unexpected charges and frustration for users.</p>

      <div class="info_panel">
        <div class="text_panel">
          <p>Hidden Cost is a strategy in deceptive patterns where additional fees or charges are concealed from users until the final stages of a transaction.<br><br>Examples of hidden costs include extra service charges, taxes, or shipping fees that only appear at the end of the checkout process. By taking advantage of users' trust and the likelihood that they won't give up on the transaction, hidden costs result in higher expenses and unforeseen charges for users.</p>

              <h3>Correct!</h3>
              <p>Audible promises users a free audiobook using a prominent button that says "Click to Try Audible Free." The mention of auto-renewal is small and appears less significant, making it easy for users to overlook this critical detail.</p>

              <p>In this example, Spotify clearly outlines the details of their free and paid plans. The mention of the free trial is secondary to the regular plan cost, clearly communicating the pricing to users and avoiding any confusion or deception.</p>
